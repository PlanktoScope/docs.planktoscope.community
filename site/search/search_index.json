Lots of plankton are very small - so small that we need tools called microscopes in order for us to see them. One type of plankton is phytoplankton: plant-like plankton which take a huge amount of carbon dioxide from the air and become the food for all other life in the water - like the grasses of the sea. Because of this, plankton are very important to the health of our planet.</p> <p>But there\u2019s still a lot we don\u2019t know about what\u2019s happening with groups of plankton and how they\u2019re changing: most tools would be too hard and expensive for us to use to get much detail about how every group of plankton is changing across an entire ocean. If we can make tools which give detailed information and which everyone can use - everywhere, all the time - then we can learn more about how the oceans will change because of things people and companies are doing.</p> <p>The PlanktoScope is a low-cost, open-source, and portable microscope designed to take detailed photos of tiny plankton from lots of water, so that we can count the different kinds of plankton in the water.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#what-is-the-planktoscope-project","title":"What is the PlanktoScope project?","text":"<p>The PlanktoScope project is a community project to develop the PlanktoScope as a tool and to help people use it for a variety of purposes around the world.

Here are a few things to consider when planning the finances for your workshop:</p> <ol> <li>Decide on the cost of the kits: One of the first things to consider is whether you want to offer the kits for sale to the participants or if you want them to purchase the kits themselves. If you choose to offer the kits for sale, you will need to factor in the cost of materials and other expenses, such as shipping and handling. If you choose to have the participants purchase the kits themselves, you will need to provide them with information on where to purchase the kits and the estimated cost.</li> <li>Check for funding opportunities: There may be organizations or foundations that would be willing to support your workshop financially. It's a good idea to research potential sources of funding such as grants, sponsorships, and crowdfunding campaigns. Additionally, look for local or regional organizations that are working in the same field as your workshop, they might be interested in supporting your initiative.</li> <li>Reach out to potential sponsors: Once you have identified potential sources of funding, reach out to them to inquire about their funding opportunities. Be prepared to provide them with information about the workshop, including the goals, objectives, and expected outcomes. Be sure to include information about the open-source nature of the project, as this may make it more attractive to organizations with an interest in open-source technology.</li> <li>Look for cost-saving options: In addition to securing funding, there are also ways to save money on expenses. Consider renting equipment or space rather than purchasing it. Reach out to local universities or community organizations to see if they have equipment or space that you can use for the workshop at a reduced cost or for free.</li> </ol> <p>Tip</p> <p>If you are organizing the workshop as an individual, consider running the project through a non-profit organization to facilitate the collection of donations. This will also help to ensure transparency and accountability for the funding received. Alternatively, you can choose a commercially active organization that can provide proper accounting and financial management for the workshop participants.

There are several ways to do this, and you probably already have a source nearby (in a culture if you are working in a lab).</p> <p>However, if you have access to a body of water (even a tiny lake or river is enough), you can build yourself a plankton net to collect a sample. Once the sample is collected, either pump it with a syringe that you connect to the machine, or dip one of the silicone tube inside the sample tube you have.</p> <p>You can then do an acquisition run. This is the best way to learn about the machine and this process!</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>After doing an acquisition, the machine should be cleaned, especially in the fluidic part. One good way to do this is to first flush the machine with clear water (distilled if possible). You can then push through a 5-10% bleach solution, or some alcohol.</p> <p>If needed you can also clean the outside of the objective lens with a soft cloth.

Plankton are small, drifting organisms that play a vital role in marine ecosystems. They include a diverse range of species, including bacteria, algae, protozoa, and small animals such as crustaceans and mollusks. Plankton nets are designed to capture these tiny organisms as they drift through the water column.</p> <p>Plankton nets typically consist of a fine mesh net attached to a long, narrow handle. The net is usually cone- or cylinder-shaped, with a small opening at the base and a wider opening at the top. The net is lowered into the water and dragged through the water column, collecting plankton as it goes. The collected plankton is then collected in a sample bottle or container for further study.</p> <p>Plankton nets can be used in a variety of aquatic environments, including oceans, lakes, and rivers. They are commonly used in scientific research to study the diversity and abundance of plankton in different ecosystems, as well as their role in the food web and the broader ecosystem. Plankton nets are also used in environmental monitoring programs to track changes in plankton populations over time.</p> <p></p> <p>The simplest device you can use is a plankton net. It should be made of a fine mesh, down to 20 micron.

However, the machine names created by this naming scheme were often difficult to pronounce, remember, and type for people in various languages, and the naming scheme sometimes generated names which sounded like curses or insults in some languages. Now, PlanktoScope machine names are generated as a combination of two words and a number up to five digits long; words are selected from pre-built lists in a language which can be chosen based on localization settings. Currently, word lists are only provided in US English, resulting in names like \"metal-slope-23501\", \"conscious-pocket-1684\", and \"plant-range-10581\"; however, word lists can be added for other languages in the future, and a user interface will eventually be provided for changing localization settings.</li> <li>(User-facing change; Application: GUI) Selecting a hardware version on the \"Hardware Settings\" page of the Node-RED dashboard now causes a default hardware preset for that version to overwrite the entire <code>hardware.json</code> file, and the Node-RED dashboard will reload the settings; this prevents the <code>hardware.json</code> file from being changed into an inconsistent mixture of settings for different hardware versions, which was the previous (incorrect) behavior. The description on the \"Hardware Settings\" page is also now more specific about what happens when a hardware version is selected.</li> <li>(User-facing change; Application: GUI, troubleshooting) Previously, the Node-RED dashboard's \"Administration\" page merged log entries from every component of the Python backend and the Node-RED dashboard.

Now the autohotspot script tries to ping <code>google.com</code> to determine whether the connection was successful, so that the autohotspot script will revert to wireless AP mode if no internet access is available over the Wi-Fi network (e.g. if the connected Wi-Fi network is actually behaving like a captive portal, which would prevent the PlanktoScope from being accessed via a VPN over the internet - in which case the PlanktoScope would become accessible only over an Ethernet cable). This change is meant to make it easier to fix a PlanktoScope's Wi-Fi connection configuration when that configuration makes internet access impossible.</li> <li>(System: networking, troubleshooting) Previously the autohotspot script would print the MAC addresses and SSIDs of all Wi-Fi networks found by scanning. Now it only prints the SSIDs of Wi-Fi networks found by scanning and avoids printing duplicate SSIDs, for more concise service logs.</li> <li>(System: networking, troubleshooting) When the autohotspot script fails to connect to google.com, it will also print some diagnostic information by attempting to ping <code>1.1.1.1</code> (the static IP address of Cloudflare DNS, so a ping without DNS lookup) and checking whether the Wi-Fi network assigned an IP address to the Raspberry Pi, and reporting the results. This enables better troubleshooting of internet access issues on Wi-Fi networks.</li> <li>(System: networking) Previously the autohotspot script was run every 5 minutes to scan for available Wi-Fi networks. Now it is run every 2 minutes, so that the PlanktoScope will connect more quickly to a Wi-Fi network which has just appeared.</li> <li>(System: networking) Previously the autohotspot script and the dhcpcd service would both try to manage when to start and stop the dnsmasq service. Now, the dnsmasq service always runs.

Now, dhcpcd is used to manage wpa_supplicant, and the autohotspot script only interacts with dhcpcd. This change was made to simplify the network configuration so that it would be easier to understand, troubleshoot, and maintain.

For this specific production, the following feed rates will be used:</p> <ul> <li>1500mm/min for 1-2mm end mills</li> <li>2500mm/min for 3mm end mills</li> <li>3500mm/min for 6mm end mills</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Load the end mill: Once the appropriate end mill has been selected, it can be loaded onto the spindle of the CNC milling machine.</p> </li> <li> <p>Set the workpiece: The workpiece should be securely clamped onto the table of the CNC milling machine.</p> </li> <li> <p>Set the machine parameters: The feed rate and end mill diameter should be entered into the machine's control panel or included in the machining program.</p> </li> <li> <p>Begin machining: The machining process should be carried out in the following sequence:</p> <ul> <li>Mill the screw holes with a 2mm end mill and then with a 3mm end mill</li> <li>Mill the corners with a 2mm end mill</li> <li>Mill everything else with a 3mm end mill</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>By following these steps, you can properly configure the feed rate and the diameter of the end mill of a CNC milling machine for the production of a workpiece. It is important to follow the manufacturer's recommendations and guidelines for the specific CNC milling machine being used, as well as to use proper safety measures while operating the machine.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"setup/hardware/v2.5/kit/#finnish-of-the-case-parts","title":"Finnish of the case parts","text":""},{"location":"setup/hardware/v2.5/kit/#requirements-for-case-parts","title":"Requirements for case parts","text":""},{"location":"setup/hardware/v2.5/kit/#case-tools","title":"Case tools","text":"<ul> <li>Hammer</li> <li>Air Compressor</li> <li>Rubber gloves</li> <li>Paper carpet pad</li> <li>Clean piece of cotton fabric</li> <li>Support material for drying the parts</li> </ul>"},{"location":"setup/hardware/v2.5/kit/#case-part-parts","title":"Case part parts","text":"<ul> <li>all case parts</li> <li>Rubio Monocoat Oil Plus 2C</li> <li>Rubio Monocoat Accelerator Component B</li> <li>Magnets</li> <li>Square nuts</li> </ul>"},{"location":"setup/hardware/v2.5/kit/#clean","title":"Clean","text":""},{"location":"setup/hardware/v2.5/kit/#stir","title":"Stir","text":""},{"location":"setup/hardware/v2.5/kit/#apply","title":"Apply","text":""},{"location":"setup/hardware/v2.5/kit/#dry","title":"Dry","text":""},{"location":"setup/hardware/v2.5/kit/#inserting-the-screws","title":"Inserting the screws","text":""},{"location":"setup/hardware/v2.5/kit/#inserting-the-magnets","title":"Inserting the magnets","text":""},{"location":"setup/hardware/v2.5/kit/#package-housing-part","title":"Package Housing part","text":""},{"location":"setup/hardware/v2.5/kit/#planktoscope-hat","title":"PlanktoScope Hat","text":"<p>Welcome to the PCB production manual for the PlanktoScope Hat!</p> <p> </p> <p>A PCB (printed circuit board) is a crucial component of many electronic devices, providing a platform for connecting and mounting electronic components.
